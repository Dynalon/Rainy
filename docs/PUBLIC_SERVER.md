Rainy public hosted cloud server
================================

About
-----

There is test server running the latest rainy release available, that can be used by anyone who wants to try out rainy, or want to develop a [Tomboy sync API][restapi] compatible application. 

Since this is for testing purposes only, there are no private account registration possible (yet).  Below you will find a list of valid username/password combinations, each representing a single account. If you pick one randomly, chances are good that no one will interfere with your notes while testing.

  [restapi]: https://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/Synchronization/REST

Setup
-----

Note: Public server is currently under maintenance and not available. It will hopefully be back by October 2013.

Pick a username/password combination below, and then use this URL in Tomboy/Tomdroid as a sync url:

	https://notesync.org/<username>/<password>/

If you for some reason really need a private account, and are unable to host a Rainy instance by yourself, [contact me][mymail] and I see what we can do.
