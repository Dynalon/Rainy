## Rainy - simple note syncing server for Tomboy

Rainy is a free synchronization/cloud server intended for use with [Tomboy][tomboy] and other Tomboy-like clients (like [Tomdroid][tomdroid]). Rainy can be easily hosted in your own private cloud, and gives you the control over your data and privacy.

### Some Facts:

  * has two different data backends that can be chosen: plain XML files (one per note) or single sqlite database
  * written in C# and runs with [mono][mono] on all major platforms (could for example be hosted at a small home server, NAS or cheap VPS/cloud server)
  * easy deployment through single _Rainy.exe_ file that only requires mono to run, all other libraries are packed, merged and statically linked
  * re-uses the existing [tomboy-library][tomboylib], which is a C# library that should one day put in place into Tomboy, and could be used by other potential clients
  * uses the awesome [ServiceStack][servicestack] framework for providing the [Tomboy REST API][tomboyrest] and the [ServiceStack.ORMLite][ss-ormlite] O/R Mapper  for database access
  * licensed under the free [GNU AGPLv3 license][agplv3]
